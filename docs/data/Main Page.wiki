<!-- Hello and welcome to wiki.gg! This page is built via our IMProved Main Page (IMP) framework. If you are familiar with CSS grid areas, that's what you're defining here! But if you don't know any CSS that's ok!

👀 RULE 1: the same keyword represents the same section & can span multiple cells
👀 RULE 2: Each box in each layout must be a CONTIGUOUS RECTANGLE of any dimensions (most likely one of: 1x1, 1x2, 2x1, 2x2, 1x3, 3x1, 3x2, 2x3)
👀 RULE 3: This page defines LAYOUT ONLY. To edit the content, please use the links provided for you after saving/previewing your page.
👀 RULE 4: If you want to RENAME or ADD a box, (1) add a new section to the grid layout below (all three breakpoints!) and then (2) save or preview this page and then (3) click "Create this box"

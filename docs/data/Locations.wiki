'''Locations''' in {{peak game}} are the areas players will find themselves in either before or during their climbing sessions. The most common locations are the biomes that dictate the conditions of each climb, the hazards the players encounter, and the types of items they can find.

== Patch history ==
{{patch|1.0|
* Introduced. }}
{{patch|1.6.a|
* Removed a weird thin green line in the airport }}
{{patch|1.8|
* We've improved performance in the Caldera and Kiln. To folks noting the abnormally low framerate in these areas, please let us know if it's still happening. (We don't have access to a big variety of computer specs!) 
* Fixed an issue where you could not reconnect properly from the top of the Alpine onwards.}}
{{patch|1.20.a|
* Added a new biome that replaces the Alpine: the MESA. The MESA will be present in every run for the next week - after which future maps will rotate randomly between the Mesa and Alpine.
* There may be a surprise waiting for you in The Kiln…
* The fog rises slightly slower in the Tropics.
* Improved performance across the board on the mountain. }}
{{patch|1.40.a|
* Added a new biome: the ROOTS.
** Delve into the ROOTS: a shrouded redwood forest infested by mushrooms and creepy-crawlies alike. This Biome replaces the TROPICS, and will be present in every run until November 17 - after which, future maps will rotate randomly between TROPICS and ROOTS. }}
